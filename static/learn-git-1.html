<p>So, you‚Äôve decided to finally learn <em>Git</em> . Either because you want to stop blindly copy-pasting commands from Stack Overflow, or because you‚Äôve just been publicly shamed by <code>git status</code>. Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôve all been there.</p>
<p>Git might seem like some black magic tool that exists just to ruin your day with merge conflicts. But it‚Äôs actually‚Ä¶ well, yeah, okay ‚Äî it <em>can</em> still ruin your day. But once you get the basics right, it becomes a lot less scary (and a lot more useful but you will still have merge conflicts).</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs break it down, nice and easy ‚Äî no <em>jargon</em> and minimal emotional damage.</p>
<h1>What is git?</h1>
<p>Git is a ‚Äúsimple and easy-to-use‚Äù <em>version control system</em> ‚Äî and by ‚Äúsimple,‚Äù I of course mean ‚Äúit will occasionally give you impostor syndrome.‚Äù But seriously, Git helps you track changes across your codebase, revert them when things inevitably go south, and generally
helps you maintain larger codebases with ease.</p>
<p>Sure, you <em>could</em> argue that Git is for the weak ‚Äî that real developers don‚Äôt need <em>version control</em> because they never make mistakes. But when you're knee-deep in a massive project or juggling contributions from a dozen teammates who all swear their code works ‚Äúon their machine,‚Äù Git suddenly starts looking like the unsung hero you never knew you needed.</p>
<hr>
<h1>How to use git?</h1>
<p>Alright, let‚Äôs keep things simple. We‚Äôll assume you already know how to use the command line and navigate to your project folder using the terminal. If that sounds like you, great ‚Äî you're all set.</p>
<p>Now, let‚Äôs walk through the steps below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please install <code>git</code> before continuing this article üòÖ</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Initializing a git repository</h2>
<p>Lets first create a new empty directory <code>Hello-World</code> where we will create a mock project to learn git. Lets create the directory and use that directory by using the following command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">mkdir Hello-World &amp;&amp; cd Hello-World
</code></pre>
<p>To first start working with git we need to <em>initialize</em> a new git repository. <em>Repository</em> refers to directory created by <em>git</em> that will track all the versions of your code.Run the command into command in the <code>Hello-World</code> directory.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">git init
</code></pre>
<p>Now whatever the changes that are made in the <code>Hello-World</code> directory git will track them (technically).</p>
<hr>
<h2>Lets create our first file</h2>
<p>We can create a file inside the <code>Hello-World</code> directory with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">echo &quot;line 1&quot; &gt;&gt; README.md
</code></pre>
<p>Now you might think Git starts tracking <code>README.md</code> immediately ‚Äî but not quite.</p>
<p>To check the status of our repository, run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">git status
</code></pre>
<p>You‚Äôll see something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git restore &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)
</code></pre>
<h3>Why isn‚Äôt Git tracking the file yet?</h3>
<p>By default, Git doesn‚Äôt track every file in the working directory. It only tracks files that have been added to the <strong>staging area</strong>.</p>
<p>Think of the <strong>staging area</strong> as a waiting room. Files go there before Git includes them in a commit.</p>
<p>To move a file to the staging area, use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">git add &lt;file_name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So in our case:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">git add README.md
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, to stage <strong>all</strong> changes in the current directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">git add .
</code></pre>
<p>Once a file is staged, Git will track it and include it in the next commit. Now lets see the status of our <em>repository</em> by using the following command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">git status
</code></pre>
<p>You will see something like this. Git tells us that <code>Readme.md</code> is a <em>new file</em> . But git won't save these changes yet.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)
        new file:   Readme.md
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h3>Creating our first commit.</h3>
<p>Think of a <strong>commit</strong> as a save point in your codebase ‚Äî like a snapshot of your project's current state. Once you create a commit, you can always go back to it. Pretty cool, right? Break your code with a segfault? No problem ‚Äî just rewind to a working state.</p>
<p>To create a commit, use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">git commit -m &quot;my first commit&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the <code>-m</code> flag is for the <strong>commit message</strong> ‚Äî a short description that helps you (and others) understand what this snapshot is about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Git only commits files in the <strong>staging area</strong>. So always use <code>git add</code> to stage your changes before committing!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To check if your commit was successful, run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">git status
</code></pre>
<p>You should see something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
</code></pre>
<p>This means everything is up to date ‚Äî no pending changes. You're good to go!</p>
<h3>Checking our logs</h3>
<p>You can view your commits using the <code>git log</code> command. This shows a history of all commits in your repository.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">git log
</code></pre>
<p>If you‚Äôve been following along, you‚Äôll see something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">commit 9971e6ab1c3c85b53b165b9e62a46408c075361f (HEAD -&gt; main)
Author: Surya Prakash &lt;example@example.com&gt;
Date:   Fri Jun 6 09:15:25 2025 +0530

    my first commit
(END)
</code></pre>
<h3>Breaking it down:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>commit</strong>: This long string is the unique <strong>hash ID</strong> of your commit ‚Äî like a fingerprint. You can use this to refer to this exact version of your code.</li>
<li><strong>Author</strong>: Who made the commit.</li>
<li><strong>Date</strong>: When the commit was made.</li>
<li><strong>Message</strong>: The description you gave using the <code>-m</code> flag.</li>
<li><strong>main</strong>: This tells you the commit is on the <code>main</code> <strong>branch</strong> (we‚Äôll talk about branches later).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>It might feel like a lot at first ‚Äî so here‚Äôs a quick summary:
<img src="static/images/20250606092538.png" alt="some image"></p>
<p>Ok about the summary part, make changes to your <em>project</em> , add those changes to the <em>staging area</em> by using <code>git add</code>, create a <em>commit</em> using <code>git commit</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Pushing our code to remote</h1>
<p>After creating a commit, the next step is to <strong>push</strong> your code to a <strong>remote repository</strong>.</p>
<h3>What is a Remote Repository?</h3>
<p>A remote repository is just a Git repository hosted on a server ‚Äî like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. It allows you to store your code online and collaborate with others.</p>
<h3>Why push code to a remote server?</h3>
<p>There are several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Team collaboration</strong>: Your teammates can work on the same project. They make changes, commit, and <strong>push</strong> their code. You can then <strong>pull</strong> those changes into your local project.</li>
<li><strong>Backup</strong>: Even if your laptop burns (please don‚Äôt test this!), your code is still safe in the remote repo.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Popular Git Hosting Platforms:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Getting the Remote URL (GitHub Example)</h3>
<p>For this guide, I will use <strong>GitHub</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an account on GitHub.</li>
<li>Create a new repository (you can skip adding README/License for now).</li>
<li>Once the repo is created, you‚Äôll see a screen like this:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="static/images/20250606094010.png" alt="some image"></p>
<p>From here, <strong>copy the HTTPS URL</strong> of the repository ‚Äî it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
</code></pre>
<p>We‚Äôll use this URL to link your local repo to the remote one. Let‚Äôs do that next!</p>
<h3>Linking your repo to a remote url</h3>
<p>Lets use the following command to link our <em>repository</em> with a remote url.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Don't forget to change the remote url before executing this command</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the above command <code>origin</code> refers to the name of the remote. You can name it however you like. But <code>origin</code> is the convention.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Pushing our code to the remote</h3>
<p>At last!! final steps .To push our code to the remote we use the following command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">git push origin main
</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>origin</code> refers to the name of the remote url that we created in the previous step. And <code>main</code> refers to the branch which we want to push. This will push our commit to the remote repository.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TLDR; only the commit which we created will be pushed and if the changes are not committed it will not be reflected in the remote repository.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Wrapping up!</h3>
<p>Ok we successfully created our <em>git repository</em> and pushed it to a remote sever. I dont wanna drag more, look for the <em>upcoming parts</em> where we will create branches and work with merge conflicts thats a whole another story. If there are any mistakes in this article or you have some suggestion feel free to drop a <em>mail</em>.</p>
