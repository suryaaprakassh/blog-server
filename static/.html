Either because you want to stop blindly copy-pasting commands from Stack Overflow, or because you’ve just been publicly shamed by <code>git status</code>. Don’t worry, we’ve all been there.</p>
<p>Git might seem like some black magic tool that exists just to ruin your day with merge conflicts. But it’s actually… well, yeah, okay — it <em>can</em> still ruin your day. But once you get the basics right, it becomes a lot less scary (and a lot more useful but you will still have merge conflicts).</p>
<p>Let’s break it down, nice and easy — no <em>jargon</em> and minimal emotional damage.</p>
<h1>🤔 What is git?</h1>
<p>Git is a “simple and easy-to-use” <em>version control system</em> — and by “simple,” I of course mean “it will occasionally give you impostor syndrome.” But seriously, Git helps you track changes across your codebase, revert them when things inevitably go south, and generally
helps you maintain larger codebases with ease.</p>
<p>Sure, you <em>could</em> argue that Git is for the weak — that real developers don’t need version control because they never make mistakes. But when you're knee-deep in a massive project or juggling contributions from a dozen teammates who all swear their code works “on their machine,” Git suddenly starts looking like the unsung hero you never knew you needed.</p>
<h1>❓ How to use git?</h1>
<p>Alright, let’s keep things simple. We’ll assume you already know how to use the command line and navigate to your project folder using the terminal. If that sounds like you, great — you're all set.</p>
<p>Now, let’s walk through the steps below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please install <code>git</code> before continuing this article 😅</p>

<h2>Initializing a git repository</h2>
<p>Lets first create a new empty directory <code>Hello-World</code> where we will create a mock project to learn git. Lets create the directory and use that directory by using the following command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">mkdir Hello-World &amp;&amp; cd Hello-World
</code></pre>
<p>To first start working with git we need to <em>initialize</em> a new git repository. <em>Repository</em> refers to directory created by <em>git</em> that will track all the versions of your code.Run the command into command in the <code>Hello-World</code> directory.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">git init
</code></pre>
<p>Now whatever the changes that are made in the <code>Hello-World</code> directory git will track them (technically).</p>
<h2>Lets create our first file</h2>
<p>We can create a file inside the <code>Hello-World</code> directory using the following command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">echo &quot;line 1&quot; &gt;&gt; README.md
</code></pre>
<p>Now git should start tracking the <code>README.md</code> right? well technically no. Ok new command time first lets see the status of our repository with the following command.</p>
